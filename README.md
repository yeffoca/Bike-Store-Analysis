# Bike-Store-Analysis

The purpose of this project is to utilize postgreSQL in tandem with DataGrip
to analyze business performance across multiple bike stores in a chain.
This initial analysis using SQL will then be visualized with Tableau.
The data comes from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/bike-store-sample-database/data.

Analysis Questions:
- How do the total sales compare between stores each month?
  - And how are sales at each store changing between months?
- How does order fulfillment time compare between stores?
- Which stores find themselves with low stock most often?
